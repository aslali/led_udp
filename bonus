Transitioning from Ethernet/UDP to serial communication introduces several challenges and required changes in the given task. While I can still utilize libraries like Boost for serial communication, the main adjustments involve managing data packetization, as serial communication lacks built-in packet boundaries like UDP. This means I must explicitly define and handle packet structure, possibly including start markers, end markers, or length indicators to ensure data integrity and synchronization between the PC and the LED Controller. For instance, in sending LED data, instead of sending a continuous stream as in UDP, I would need to segment the data into packets, prepend each packet with a header specifying its length or include a termination character, and implement mechanisms for error detection and flow control to prevent data loss or corruption over the serial link. These changes ensure reliable communication despite the lower bandwidth (Serial communication typically operates at lower speeds) and different nature of serial communication compared to Ethernet.
